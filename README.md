# What is this repo? #
This is a repo started by Cat Chamberlain for the Tree Spotters. It has some useful code, and lots of great info on running the USA NPN Tree Spotters program.
But it is big and messy (lots of ppt etc.)
So we now have called it treespottersOG and have a treespotters repo where code will be developed now.
